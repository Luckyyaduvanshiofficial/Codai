## 📥 Installation Options

### Option 1: 📦 Portable Executable (Recommended for Labs)
```bash
# Download from releases page
1. Go to: https://github.com/luckyyaduvanshi/codaipro/releases
2. Download: CodaiPro-v2.1-Portable.zip
3. Extract and run: CodaiPro_v21.exe
```

> **Note**: The portable zip does **not** include an AI model (it's ~2-5GB). Download one model into the `models` folder next to the exe — see [Downloading a Model](#-downloading-a-model). This is a one-time step; after that everything runs offline.

### Option 2: 🐍 Python Installation (For Developers)
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/luckyyaduvanshi/codaipro.git
cd codaipro

# Install dependencies (Python 3.11 recommended)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download an AI model (one-time, needs internet)
# Either run the helper...
DOWNLOAD_MODEL.bat
# ...or manually place a .gguf file into the models/ folder
# (create the folder if it doesn't exist)

# Run application
python launcher.py
```

### Option 3: 🔧 Build from Source
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/luckyyaduvanshi/codaipro.git
cd codaipro

# Build portable executable
BUILD_V21.bat

# Find executable in: dist_portable/CodaiPro_v21/
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For Students (Lab Environment)
1. **Download** the portable version from [releases](https://github.com/luckyyaduvanshi/codaipro/releases)
2. **Extract** to your USB drive or desktop
3. **Download a model** (one-time, at home) into the `models` folder — see [below](#-downloading-a-model)
4. **Double-click** `CodaiPro_v21.exe`
5. **Start coding** with AI assistance!

### For Developers
1. **Clone** the repository
2. **Install** Python 3.11 and dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. **Download** a model into the `models/` folder
4. **Run** `python launcher.py`
5. **Customize** and contribute!

## 🧠 Downloading a Model

CodaiPro runs a local GGUF model through llama.cpp — no API keys, no cloud calls. You need one `.gguf` file in the `models/` folder (next to `launcher.py` or the exe). The app auto-detects whichever you install.

| Model | Size | Best For | Source |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| **Phi-3.5-mini** ⭐ | 2.3GB | Best speed/quality balance | [microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-gguf](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-gguf) |
| **Qwen2.5-Coder-3B** | 2GB | Fast coding on low-spec machines | [Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct-GGUF) |
| **Qwen2.5-Coder-7B** | 4.7GB | Most powerful (q4_k_m) | [Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-GGUF) |

- Pick the **q4** / **q4_k_m** quantization for the best CPU performance.
- If a model downloads as split parts (`...-00001-of-00002.gguf`), keep **all** parts together in `models/` — llama.cpp loads them as one.
- Run `DOWNLOAD_MODEL.bat` for a guided download with these links.
